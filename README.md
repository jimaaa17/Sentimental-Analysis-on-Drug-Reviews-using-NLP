## Sentimental-Analysis-on-Drug-Reviews-using-NLP
Analysis of the drugs name, conditions, reviews and its recommendation for health condition of a patient.

## Problem Statement



Online health-related sites and opinion forums contain ample information about the user's preferences and experiences over multiple drugs and treatment. This information can be leveraged to obtain valuable insights using data mining approaches such as sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis measures the inclination of peopleâ€™s opinions through techniques like text analysis and natural language processing. Online user reviews in this domain contain information related to multiple aspects such as the effectiveness of drugs and side effects, which make automatic analysis very interesting but also challenging. However, analyzing the sentiments of drug reviews can provide valuable insights. They might help pharmaceutical companies and doctors to quickly get into bad reviews and know patients' complaints. This sentiment analysis on drug reviews is basically modeled as a classification problem (i.e.,) classifying the sentiment of the user whether positive, negative or neutral based on their choice of words and their reviews. A lot of symptoms and drug sides were hidden under reviews, which will be great to be automatically extracted to improve the drug and help to give a better prescription.

## Question to answer from the data:
- Can you predict the patient's condition based on the review?
- Can you predict the rating of the drug based on the review?
- Can you determine if a review is positive, neutral, or negative?
- What are the key factors of sentiment derived from rating on basis of drug review?
